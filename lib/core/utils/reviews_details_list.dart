        "When I moved 10 years ago, I had to learn to use an electric stove.  Now this is the first new one I’ve had.  Everything is working well!  The stove top knobs and the oven setting dial are easy to use.  And it’s the same size as my old one. I was pleased with how quickly the guys were able to install it.  I haven’t baked a pie yet….but I’m sure it will do just fine.",
